<h2 id="so-where-it-started">*So, where it started? *</h2>
<p>As I said in readme, Go Fridge is originally my capstone project for my Certificate of Software Engineering study. But the idea came to my mind earlier.<br>
<em>Why build it instead of using something ready-made by others?</em> Not many options and most of them are not that user-friendly, the features are not meet my requirements. However, as a compsci graduate who took too many theory papers over software / web development papers, I didn't know <strong>HOW</strong>.<br>
I can explain to you the algorithms I learnt, I can write some code, I even know some html and css, but how should I create an application from scratch? So I decided to upskilling myself.</p>
<h2 id="and-then-whats-the-problem">*And then? What's the problem? *</h2>
<p>I learnt a lot from the programme. Well, you can check that skill part in my resume.</p>
<p>During my study, there're so many problems. I resolved some of them, am resolving some of them, and hope I can resolve all of them in the near future.</p>
<p>The main problem is, apparently I have no idea of the complication of an application. I've designed a very complicate and cumbersome database at the very beginning and spent a lot of time on the backend code, trying to implement the design. Later, I had to simplify the design or it would have been impossible to complete.</p>
<p>And then, I realised, I can do the front-end and the backend but how to combine them? It also took me awhile. Still need to practice more. My backend code is good (at least for this project), api works perfect. At least they were perfect when I test them via postman.<br>
<img src="https://endofheat.github.io/post-images/1712239573411.png" alt="Backend api test checklist" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>But the functions didn't work well on the front-end. Not every function works bad tho, but still.. not ideal.</p>
<p>And there's a silly problem. I totally forgot that I put the api keys in .env file and I commit &amp; sync it several times before I found it out. I've tried to delete the file and made a new one, it's my first time to know if you upload something new with an old name, all the commit history will comeback like an old friend. <em>sigh</em> The good thing is, this is a small project and didn't cause any troubles to anyone. I can apply the new keys and fix these problems, YAY. Impressive and won't happen again.</p>
<p>Oh and, the comments. I wrote some comments but some times I thought I can add the comments later and you know some times later means never. <strong>Don't forget the comments!!! The future you need the comments!!!</strong></p>
<h2 id="whats-next">*What's next?  *</h2>
<p>Fix the bugs, make the functions work well, make the UI more friendly and comfortable. It's responsive design but need to improve. TBH, it might be my bad but I think MUI is not that good. I will learn TailwindCSS and redo the front-end. TailwindCSS seems pretty good in responsive design.</p>
<p>There's so much more I want to say! But it's 3:24 am now and I have to leave at 5:30 am for flight. My friends are travelling to NZ from CN, they need me as a tour guide and translator. See you next time. (I don't think there's any readers, but, well, see you after 15th Apr. )</p>
