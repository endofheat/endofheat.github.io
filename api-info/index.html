They have a bachelor degree in compsci. Why it's compsci not software development? It's a long story but the keywords are: doraemon, AI, once had a dream. </p>\n<p style = \"text-align: justify\">Finished their bachelor in Aotearoa and now living in Aotearoa. </p>\n<p style = \"text-align: justify\">Cat and dog person. Love to play video games, to write fictions. Goals: write some short fictions in English next year.  </p>\n<p style = \"text-align: justify\">If it helps, yes, they are an INTP (sometimes INTJ) and virgo. They are introvert but talkative. More like a talkative cat but not the 'hooman I need ya attenion' type cat. </p>\n<p style = \"text-align: justify\">Did I ever mention that 'Akira' is an unisex name and kinda related to my wallet name? :D not a Japanese tho. BTW 'Akira' is also a name of a well-known manga (and animated cyberpunk action film), yes that AKIRA (the banner of my LinkedIn is 'Akira', that fablous red motorcycle from AKIRA. ) </p>\n<h3 id=\"here\">Here</h3>\n<p style = \"text-align: justify\">It should be a tech blog but it's a personal blog that has everything Akira wants to share. It would be great if you can find something helpful or interesting in here :) but that's not my intention. My intention was to have a place to talk, to share. </p>","avatar":"","caf":"#84fab0","ccf":"#5f6169","ccs":"#999fa7","ctf":"#ffffff","cts":"#dddddd","customCss":"","descfriend":"","dribbble":"","facebook":"","friends":[],"ga":"","github":"https://github.com/endofheat","isEnabledCustomColor":false,"mermaid":true,"pageSize":"5","placeholder":"Just Go Go","recordIp":false,"skin":"green","twitter":"","vMaxWidth":"1000","vPadding":"2.5%","vPercentWidth":"100","valine":false,"visitor":false,"weibo":"","zhihu":""},"utils":{"now":1712241062552}}
